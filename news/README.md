So all these articles are written in **markdown** and automatically compiled to the website. Markdown is just a super easy way to format things, you're probably already familiar with it from popular messaging sites such as *Reddit*, *WhatsApp*, or *Discord*. It's just really basic things, like:

- Begin each document with a `## Your Title` and then a `### Date - Your Name` subtitle.
- `**bold**` text is written with two stars around it.
- `*italic*` text is written with one star.

### Images

Should be done in the format:

`![](../images/{YOUR_ARTICLE_NAME}.jpg)`

or `.png` or whatever file-extension. Upload your image to the `/images` folder. Alternatively you can link to an external site by replacing the entire content in the `()`. Example:

`![](../images/cuppers1.jpg)`
`![](https://cdn.cherwell.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/30010234/chess-club.jpg)`
