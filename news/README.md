# Onboarding

So all these articles are written in **markdown** and automatically compiled to the website. Markdown is just a super easy way to format things, you're probably already familiar with it from popular messaging sites such as *Reddit*, *WhatsApp*, or *Discord*. It's just really basic things, like:

- Begin each document with a `## Your Title` and then a `### Date - Your Name` subtitle.
- Add pictures using a `<src img="https://LinkToYourPicture.jpg">` anywhere in your text.
- `**bold**` text is written with two stars around it.
- `*italic*` text is written with one star.
