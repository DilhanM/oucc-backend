On board 1, Joris Gerlagh challenged IM Li Tian Yeoh, Malaysia Chess Champion in 2015 and 2016. Joris remarks:

> Though I already knew I would almost certainly be playing Ti Lian, I had only prepared with the black pieces, unfortunate when I came up with white after the coin toss. I then decided to play a sideline against the Dutch defence so that neither of us would know the opening theory.

Proceeding with a quick exchange of all minor pieces in the early midgame, though slightly worse due to piece inactivity, Joris sacrificed a pawn to gain a kingside attack and achieved an entirely drawn rook endgame during the time scramble, in which a draw was quickly agreed.

On board After an opening inaccuracy in the Tarrasch QGD from my opponent, Richard was left on board 3 with an IQP position with very little compensation for the pawn weakness. The middlegame was mostly quiet and he was able to take trades into a favrouable endgame, which he converted by winning Black's Queen-Pawn.

On board 4, Andrew had a messy game in the King's Indian Fianchetto variation. He managed to win a pawn on the queenside after some lines opened, but his opponent had some pressure with his active pieces. Various complications ensued, and with both players quite low on time, the game ended in a draw when the Imperial player failed to spot a winning plan in the endgame and liquidated instead.

On board 5, Aloysius ruthlessly steamrolled his hapless opponent in a Nimzo-Indian Samisch, executing a deadly rook-lift on move 15 which skewered black's queen to his kingside. Imperial's board 5 simply declined to defend, offering up a piece to belay the attack which Aloysius promptly declined in favour of trapping the queen. A time-pressured clean-up secured the win.

We're very grateful for Imperial for coming up to Oxford to play and look forward to future matches with the team. See the article on the last time the Valentine Cup was played in 2008 on [page 53 of this news article](https://issuu.com/rspall/docs/2008_1400_a)
