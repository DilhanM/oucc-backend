## The Third team takes an early win against Didcot

### 21st October 2019 - by Boris Gusev

Overall score of 4.5-1.5, but given how close some of the games were, we are definitely looking forward to a rematch!

Board one had Alekhineâ€™s defence with a very early queen trade resulting in a draw.

Board two had a nail biter with 3 passes connected pawns vs a bishop, but with very little time left. A small crowd formed watching moves being blitzed out in a tense game. Unfortunately we did end up flagging

Board three had a nice positional advantage with two strong knights in a closed position. However a QR battery looked too intimidating, and a wrong step with a pawn in front of the king blocking the only escape square for the knight left us a piece down.

My game ended with a rushed miscalculation on my part, and what should have been a pawn advantage turned into being a rook down...

Our board five was a new player for the team, and he had a nice win, being a couple pawns up in mid game left his opponent spending a lot of time hoping for some counter play. None was found and a win was secured.
