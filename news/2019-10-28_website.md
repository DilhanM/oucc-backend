## New website release

### 28th October 2018 - by Aloysius Lip

The website has undergone a rewrite to a technology called [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/). To the casual user, that really means nothing, for now we're keeping the *look* and *feel* of the site exactly the same. However, from our side what it means is that we can *update* and *post* a lot more frequently! It's a lot easier to change things.

How do you contribute? All you need is a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source_repo=oxfordunichess%2Foucc-backend). Once you've made that, navigate to [here](https://github.com/oxfordunichess/oucc-backend/tree/master/news) and click 'Create new file'. And that's it! Copy the formatting of the other examples if you're stuck. We review and approve all changes you make. Ask us if you have any questions.

If you have talents and feel like contributing to this community, why don't you help out:
- [Writing](https://github.com/oxfordunichess/oucc-backend/tree/master/news): We've made it super easy to contribute to these articles and we're looking for more content! Anyone willing to write on match reports, events, or just anything else interesting in the chess world to be published righ here on this site, please [contact](/contact) us! It's super easy to do.
