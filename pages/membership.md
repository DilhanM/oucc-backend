# Membership

## Club Membership

We are an open, friendly organisation and welcome all non-members to come along to our events free-of-charge on a trial basis. However, if you wish to represent the university in matches and tournaments against other universities, or find yourself coming to our events often (especially classes and league matches) we will ask you to pay one of our two membership rates:

1. Yearly Membership: £15
2. Life Membership: £25

You can either pay in cash at any of our events, via online banking, or via PayPal.

Our PayPal page can be found at [https://www.paypal.me/oucc](https://www.paypal.me/oucc). Please write a note stating your name and confirming your selection of length of membership.

Alternatively, use the sort code 40-35-34 and account number 90632937 and use a reference stating your name and desired length of membership.

## ECF Membership

If you want to play regularly for our [teams](/leagues) then we are required to charge you £3 per match for every game after your first unless you join the English Chess Federation at Bronze level or above. You can join the ECF online at [www.englishchess.org.uk](http://www.englishchess.org.uk).

To be eligible to play our matches for free we need to know that you are an ECF member - contact our [Treasurer](/committee) once you have joined.
