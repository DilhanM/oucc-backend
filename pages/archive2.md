<div>There's a whole host of exciting chess on offer this term. Things are kicking off from Wednesday, when we're starting our freshers' blitz tournament at Christ Church at 7:30pm. At 5 minutes a game, blitz chess is a refreshing way to add an element of frantic scrabbling to a game that's typically thought of for its sophistication.</div>

<div>Why not download our [termcard](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chess/#termcard) so you can keep up with everything going on? In particular, write down our freshers' varsity in your diary and join us in showing the other place why we're the best university!</div>

<div>Finally, our second team begins their season tomorrow away at Witney. New players are always welcome to get involved in competitive chess, so please feel free to read about our [teams](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chess/#leagues).</div>

<div>See you around!</div>

## OUCC 1s Finish 4th in ODCL Div 1

### Sat, 04 May 2013 15:00:00 -0700

After charging through to a brilliant start at the beginning of the season, Uni 1 had sights aimed high. Taking the scalps of the county's top teams like Witney and Cowley was a definite highlight. But as fatigue started to set in, our strained team struggled to stay in form. We ended with a respectable 4th place in the middle of the league, in line with the results of the past few years. As Uni players come and go ever so frequently, we were very fortunate to have such a strong batch of new players this year. It was a season well fought, let's hope for the best next year!

## OUCC 2s to Remain in ODCL Div 3

### Tue, 30 Apr 2013 18:00:00 -0700

## Report by Erik Thörnblad

After a tough season Uni II finally showed what they are worth by beating City III with 5-1, thus avoiding relegation! Captain Noam's game was the first to finish. His opponent missed that his knight was attacked by a pawn, and after that it was easy task cleaning up. Ben won a piece in an effective way by forcing his opponent to shut in his own bishop which could then be attacked by a pawn. Meanwhile, Matthew played a heavy piece endgame with a pawn up, and traded down to a winning pawn endgame that he handled well. At that point the top three boards were still playing, with myself being a pawn up after an extremely early d5 in the Spanish from my opponent, and later a whole rook up since my opponent's king was stuck in the centre and the tactics couldn't be stopped. I later blundered a bishop back (doh!), but the endgame was still easily winning with an outside passer. Sean outplayed his opponent in a Grand Prix Attack and won the ensuing endgame easily. The craziest game of the day was board 2, where Hendrik as black had an extremely sharp King's Indian. I'm not too sure what happened, for every time I went over it looked completely different. Well played everyone, and thanks for this season!</div>

### Write-up by Howard Chiu

**1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 a6 6.g3 Qc7 7.Qa4** Speelman noted that this was an odd position for the queen in the post-mortem. [7.Bg2 Qxc4 8.0–0 Nc6 9.Nb3 d5 10.Bf4 Qb4 11.Re1 Be7 12.e4 Nxe4 Shimanov - Zhigalko, 0–1, 2012] **7...Nc6 8.Nc2** [8.Nxc6 bxc6 9.Bg2 Rb8 10.Qc2 Be7 11.0–0 0–0= has been played before.] **8...Be7 9.Bg2 0–0 10.0–0 d6 11.Ne3 Bd7 12.Qc2 Ne5 13.b3 Rac8**

preparing b5 which cannot be stopped due to the numerous pins down the c-file.**14.Ba3** [14.Bb2 b5 15.cxb5 axb5 16.Qd2 Qb8; 14.f4 Neg4 15.Nxg4 Nxg4 16.e4 b5 _(16...Qc5+ 17.Kh1 Ne3 18.Bxe3 Qxe3 19.e5 dxe5 20.Rae1 Qb6 21.fxe5)_ 17.Qe2 Nf6 18.e5 Ne8 19.Be3 bxc4 20.Bd4 d5] **14...b5 15.Ne4 Nxe4 16.Bxe4 f5 17.Bg2 f4?!** Inspired but it turns out that White can hold adequately with accurate play. [17...bxc4 18.Rac1 Qa5 wins a pawn outright 19.Bb2 Qxa2 20.Bxe5 Qxc2 21.Rxc2 dxe5 22.Nxc4 Bb5 23.e4 Rfd8] **18.gxf4 Rxf4 19.Qd2 Rh4** [here Fritz found 19...bxc4 20.Nd5 exd5 21.Qxf4 Qa5 22.Bc1 c3 23.Be3 c2 24.Rfc1 Qb5 25.Bd4 Qxe2 26.Bxd5+ Kh8; The alternative that I was considering loses the d6 pawn without much compensation 19...Rcf8?! 20.Rad1 bxc4 21.Bxd6 Bxd6 22.Qxd6 Qxd6 23.Rxd6] **20.Rfd1** stopping any ideas of ...d5! with Nf3+ and Qxh2# **20...Nf7 21.Rac1=**

White has developed quite nicely while Black is starting to put his pieces on weird squares.**21...Qa7 22.cxb5 Rxc1 23.Qxc1** [23.Rxc1 axb5 24.Bb4 Bd8 25.Nf1 Bb6 26.e4=] **23...axb5 24.Bb2** here I had a tough choice between depriving the knight of c4 or the queen of c3, and I decided that the latter was more annoying. **24...b4** [24...d5 25.Nf1 Bc5 26.e3 b4; 24...Qxa2 25.Qc3 Bf6 26.Qc7 Qxb2 27.Qxd7=] **25.Qa1 Bg5 26.Nc4** [The alternative I was looking at was 26.Bd4 Qa6 27.Qb2 e5 28.Bc5 Bh3 29.Bxh3 Rxh3 here Fritz found 30.Bxb4 Rxe3! 31.fxe3 Bxe3+ 32.Kg2 Qc6+ 33.Kg3 Ng5 34.Rd3 (34.Rxd6 Bf4+ 35.Kh4 _(35.Kf2 Nh3+ 36.Ke1 Qh1#)_ 35...Qe4 36.Bd2 Bxd2+ 37.Kh5 Qxe2+ 38.Kh4 Qxh2+ 39.Kg4 Qh3#) 34...Qh1 35.Rxe3 Qg1+ 36.Kh4 Qxh2+ 37.Kxg5 Qf4+ 38.Kh5 g6#] **26...Bf4? 27.h3 d5 28.Ne5 Ng5??**

I was so caught up in trying to break through on the kingside that my pieces have ended up in a nasty tangle without me realising it. Here the both of us were down to a few minutes with no increments.**29.e3?** Pretty much the only move that loses; moving either piece to d4 would have sufficed. [29.Bd4 Qc7 30.e3 Bxe5 31.Bxe5 Qc2 32.Rd4 Nxh3+ 33.Bxh3 Rxh3 34.Qd1 Qxd1+ 35.Rxd1 Rh5=; 29.Rd4!
